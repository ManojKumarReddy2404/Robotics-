# Demystifying Robotics: The STANFORD Robot & RoboAnalyzer

This repository is based on my article **[Demystifying Robotics: A Deep Dive into the STANFORD Robot and RoboAnalyzer](https://medium.com/@manojreddy2404/demystifying-robotics-a-deep-dive-into-the-stanford-robot-and-roboanalyzer-ab7310a482d9)**.  
It explores the **STANFORD robot**, one of the earliest and most studied 6-DOF serial manipulators, using the simulation tool **RoboAnalyzer**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Introduces the STANFORD Robot â€“ structure, history, and applications.  
- Demonstrates **forward and inverse kinematics** using RoboAnalyzer.  
- Simulates **joint trajectories** and generates graphs for joint angles, velocities, and accelerations.  
- Performs **workspace analysis** to visualize the robotâ€™s reachability and limitations.  
- Serves as a **learning resource** for robotics students and enthusiasts.
